Written Report:

One trend identified in this analysis concerns the difference between charter schools and district schools. Charter schools have better performance in reading and math across the board, as well as a much higher overall passing percentage of students in their schools compated to the district schools.

Another trend identified in this analysis may seem counter-intuitive. The schools with higher per student spending actually had worse performance than those with less spending. In fact, the lowest per student spending group returned the highest performances in all categories.
